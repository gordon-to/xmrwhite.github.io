        <p class="about-me">
          I'm a student at University of Toronto working towards a BSc in Computer Science. I began programming at my high school where I was introduced to the One Laptop per Child initiative. This program brought me all the way to Isiolo, in Kenya, where I deployed a classroom set of laptops in 2009. I returned three times to grow the collection to over 80 computers that are still being used today. I'm always looking for new ways to solve big problems.
